# Women In Japan 2017

This is the repo for the 2017 Women In Japan conference hosted by Students Advocating for Gender Equality (SAGE).

This website is a SPA (single page app) running on Angular 2 and hosted on Github Pages. Lots of love to the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular-buch/angular-cli-ghpages) for making that a relatively easy process.
