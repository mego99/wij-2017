    <p>All participants must register to attend the conference. We are a secure campus with entrance requirements, and we also have seating limitations at our venues. Please register through the registration tab.</p>

    <p>If the Google form does not work for you, please email "wij.sage@gmail.com" with your name, email address, grade, school, and if you would like a Japanese to English translation headset.</p>
